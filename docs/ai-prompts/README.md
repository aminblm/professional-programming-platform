# AI Prompts for the Professional Programming Platform

I use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in order to chat with it around the development process of the [Professional Programming Platform](https://github.com/aminblm/professional-programming-platform)

## Initializers

### Meta Initilizer configuration

It is the configuration of the initializer: `intializer.meta.txt`.

### Initilizer per ticket

The initializer prompts serve as context setting for the AI. 

The naming goes as follows: `initializer.0.0.<ticket-number>-<ticket-name>.txt`.
